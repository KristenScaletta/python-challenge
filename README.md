# python-challenge

The contents of this folder execute two different and unrelated sets of code.

Under PyBank, you will find source code (main.py) that performs a variety of calcukations on financial data and can be run in a terminal. It also outputs a text file which I included under Analysis.

Under PyPoll, you will find source code (main.py) that calculates votes per candidate, percent votes and the winner of an election. This can also be run in a terminal and outputs a text file which I included under Anaylsis.
